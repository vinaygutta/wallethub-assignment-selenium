Create a light user account in https://wallethub.com/join/light and uncheck the checkbox to get
your free credit score and report. This is the account you should be using for this test. Then
simulate the following actions:

1. Go to this URL: http://wallethub.com/profile/test_insurance_company/
2. On the reviews section of the page, hover over the stars and click on the fourth star. Your
code should actually (a) do the hover and (b) make sure the stars inside get lit up when you
hover over them, then (c) click on the fourth star. Simply redirecting the WebDriver to the next
page isn’t an option.
3. On the page you get redirected to, click on the Policy dropdown and change the value to
“Health Insurance”.
4. Click on the link “Write a review” and write some random text (minimum of 200 characters).
5. Press submit.
6. If you are successful, you should see a confirmation screen saying you have reviewed the
institution. You then have to go to your profile and confirm that the “review feed” got updated.
7. Go to https://wallethub.com/profile/ and assert that you can see the review.
